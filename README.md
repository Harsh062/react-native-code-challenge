# react-native-code-challenge
A simple app built using React Native to display the monthly and weekly the glucose level of patients for a clinic

## Info
* **Platform:** iOS
* **State Management:** React

## Develop
#### iOS
1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ npm run clean`
3. `$ npm start`
4. Open your Xcode, select a simulator, click the play button or `cmd + R`

#### Android
I've developed it for iOS. Though there isn't any OS specific code (except asking for the users permission while giving access to the camera), other parts of the application should run fine with the same commands for android.
